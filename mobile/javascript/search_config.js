I also want to             disprove some myths, clear a fkw misconceptions and, try to even dispel the             misgivings that may be lurking in your mind about theory. In this unrf too, I propose             to chart out the growth and proliferation of theory in the 20\"  century.              1.1  INTRODUCTION               In this section I want to talk about some words which you use in literary conversation             and writing. The questions I ask are :                     what is literature                    what is lherary criticism and             •      what is theory              But before you read the following  try to answer those questions yourself, and then see             if you and I are thinking along the same lines. Do not worry about the correctness of             your answers.               1.1.1  What is Literature              Sometimes simple questions flummox us simply because we take certain things and             ideas, about which questions cannot be asked, for granted. The question, which             appara in the forin of a heading to this section, belongs to that category. One of the             easy, always known, and, yet difficult to answer questions. Nonetheless let me make             an attempt to tackle it and some other related questions.              The term \"Li\&mture\", as Rap\&  Williams, with whose work you may already be             Eamiliar, has reminded us, is of a comparatively recent origin. Originally, it referred             to, as indeed it still does, my written, printed matter on any subject. We still refer to             medical \"literature\", talk about availability or otherwise of \"literature\" on a subject   \"             etc. Earlier  signified something similar. It is from this source that the tenn,","An Introduction      \"literate\" was derived. Sometime in the 19~ century it began connoting specifically                                      what was earlier covered under the broad rubric of \"poetry\". As an academic                                      discipline, \"classics\" and \"rhetoric\" preceded it. Literature's critical meaning is still                                      visible in the use of the word \"literature\". Matthew Arnold (1822-88) gave it the final                                      seal of its current meaning in his famous essays. Now in its specialized use it means                                      what poetry used to signify in earlier times. It includes all imaginative writing :                                      poetry, fiction, drama. The rise of the notion of literature is intimately related to ?he                                      growth of the print industry, when texts were easily duplicated in the wake of the                                      steam-run printing machines during the Industrial Revolution (1750-1850) in Europe.                                      Books became commodities as the capitalist market economy generated a middle                                      class which had the leisure and the literacy to read books.  The idea of literature grew                                      along with another allied concept, that of culture. I am tsmpted to draw a simple                                      relationship between these: agricukure->Industrilization->leisure->literature-                                      >culture.                                        1.1.2  What is Literary Criticism                                        This too is one of those awkward questions about which I have already told you.                                      When someone asks you whether you like a particular book, a novel, a short story,                                      and you say \"yes\"  or \"no\"  you are on the threshold of literary criticism. When she                                      asks you why, and then you attempt an answer trying to rationalize your perception,                                      you are \"doing\"  literary criticism, albeit at a rudimentary level. Similarly, you do film                                      or art criticism.  Understanding and interpreting literary experience, even when not                                      articulated can be literary criticism. Now, this can be an amateurish response.                                      Alternatively, it could also be a highly sophisticated, professional one of the kind we                                      generally read in  review columns or journals.                                       English poets and critics whose works you read have battled over the question of the                                      relative superiority or otherwise of criticism over creation: Wordsworth and Arnold,                                      for example. Some enduring criticism has also come into being by way of \"Defense                                      of Poetry\".  You already know of some ofthese, such as Sidney's (1554-1586) and                                      Shelley's (1792-1822) Essays.  The classical criticism ofthe Greeks and Romans                                      grew around attacks on and defense of the position of poets in a civil society.                                       \"Aesthetics\" and \"Poetics\" were terms that were earlier used before the vogue of                                      \"Criticism\" set in.  You can find brief histories of such common words ii Raymond                                      Williams's book entitled keywords.  And then, more recently, \"theory\" was                                      introduced into our departments.                                        1.1.3  What is Theory                                        Let me try to define the term \"theory\" for you. You can, if you like, make necessary                                      changes.                                       Very generally speaking, A THEORY (any theory) provides a system by which                                      experience can be organized and made sense of, or at least into something which will                                      be comprehensible.                                       All theories are constructed against the threat of chaos, which is the absence of                                      system or organizing principles, to make sense of what comes to us, however,                                      provisional and imperfect that sense may have to be. That is the basis of all dokma,                                      religious and political alike.                                       What applies to life also applies to our experience of works of art. How does a work                                      of art mean what it means? How do we make sense of the work, whether it be a                                      literary, or non-literary text?  Under what conditions is meaning produced?  Literary                                      Theory, as we know it, owes its ongin to human attempt to deal with these issues.                                      Where does meaning lie: In the text or in the mind of the reader? Does the author use","the form of the poem or novel as an empty receptacle, which she then fills          Literature,               (impregnates, like the Heavenly Muse, dove llke, as Milton says) with meaning?      Criticism and               What effect does it produce in the mind of the reader? Does the subjectivity of the   Theory               reader determine or contribute to the meaning of the work of artAiterature that she is               exposed to? Or, is meaning an objective reality, having an ontological status? Does               the reader make special attempts to get at the meaning immanent in the text? You can               see that these are clearly philosophical issues. The philosopher asks similar questions               about objective and absolute reality whether the tree that I see or touch is the reality.                In their philosophical writing, Hobbes (1588-1679) and Locke (1632-1704) talk about               \"wit\" and \"judgement\" and illustrate their general theory by referring to (among other               categories of knowledge, like History,) poetry. Hobbes says, \"In a good poem.. . both               Judgement and Fancy are required..  . . Judgement without Fancy is wit, but Fancy               without Judgement  not.\" The eighteenth century philosopher, Kant (1724-1804), had               talked about \"Aesthetic Judgment\" as opposed to \"Moral Judgment\", and described it               as \"purposiveness w\&out  purpose\". Wordsworth's (1770-1850) theory of literature               in his \"Preface\" to the Lyrical Ballads is as much literary criticism as \"theory7' : the               Romantic theory of poetry.                Instead of making a contradistinction between Weory\" and \"criticism7' one can               perhaps talk about \"Practice\" as an antonym to theory. So we often come up with               statements like: \"In theory this sounds all right. But in practice, it is impossible to               achieve\". Hence the pun in Aijaz Ahmad's book, In Theory. I am reminded of the title               of one of Ezra Pound's (1885-1972) books, How to Read, which (that is, the phrase,               not the book) can be used to define what we understand by theory. As long as we go               on talking about how to read we are doing literary theory. Once we start reading a               text in accordance with those dicta, we are doing literary criticism.                It might be helpful in this context to recall what David Lodge says. Literary critics, he               says,  have since the 1960's shown \"a much greater intent in, and anxiety about, the               theory of their own subject (what is sometimes called, after Aristotle, poetics) than               was formerly the case, at least in Britain and America\". He further says, \"literary               criticism has been drawn into.the cortex of a powerful new field of study in which all               [the] disciplines are merged and interfused, and which goes under the general noun of               %eoryt\" @ ix). We will examine more of this and also the subtle distinction between               \"criticism\" and \"theory\" presently.                1.1.4  Contradistinction                 By definition then, you can see the difference between what is generally referred to as               theory, and what we have always known as literary criticism. Theory, in the context               of literature, is the set of broad assumptions about literature, and the function of               criticism. When you say, for example, that economic condition of a society, its modes               of production, and class system, in any given time determine the literature of that               society in that given period of its history, you are making a theoretical               pronouncement. However, when you start analyzing any work of art, a poem or a               novel of that society and period fkom that theoretical perspective, you are doing               literary criticism. This kind of \"reading\" of literature is, of course, known as Marxist               criticism, that is literary criticism where you have applied the Marxist \"theory\" of               literature, And, you may have done it yourself, without knowing it! \"Reading\" in this               sense is purposive reading, with theory in mind. Literary criticism, you may say, thus,               is applied theory.                 Secondly, or to put the same thing in a different way, whereas the object of literary               aiticism is any given, particular, literary (oral or written) work, that of classical               psetics or contemporary theory is usually generalization about literature. Invariably,               it is the second which leads to the practice of the first. This indeed is what scientific               method is all about: from the particular or indivi 1-4 case studies to  the general; and","then application of the general principles or theory to the individual or particular                                     works.                                      For some reason, the term theory, as opposed to literary criticism, came into vogue                                     when structuralism and post-structuralism opposed new criticism. In this sense,                                     theory is used to describe a wide range of approaches from the Marxist to the                                     deconstructionist school. But, as early as 1957, Wimsatt and Broqks used the term                                     theory in referring to any broad assumptions about literature, even in the case of the                                     works of classical writers such as Horace (65-8 BC) or medieval writers, such as                                     Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-74). They refer to Horace as a \"literarytheorist\". They also                                     talk about how  \"Literary theory and criticism received a new emphasis in Italy                                     during that phase of the geneml Renaissance which was speeded by the western                                     movement..  . \" What Horace says about certain literary works, their relative merit or                                     demerit, is criticism. But surely, he says all these with certain broad assumptions in                                     mind, or even expressed ones. As Wimasatt and Brooks say, \"The main thing                                     assumed in the criticism of Horace is the normative value of the literary 'species'                                     (P 80).                                       But when we talk of theory here, or even for that matter, whenever we talk about                                     theory, what we have in mind is the more recent phenomenon of \"doing\" theory. That                                      is to say, the structuralist and poststructuralist turning in literary criticism: from                                      Mandsm to Deconstruction, from Foucault to the speech-act theory, is a academic                                     phenomenon of the second half of the twentieth century. In addition, theory has                                      broken the disciplinary boundaries between various academic disciplines.                                        1.2    BACKGROUND TO THE CONTEMPORARY                                             SITUATION IN THEORY                                       h this section 1 try to give historical reasons for the rise of theory in the latter half of                                     the 20\& century. Naturally, this history will be mv version of what happened, which                                      will be coloured by whatever history I have read and heard from others. You should                                      not--must not--take for granted indiscriminately all that I say by way of                                      generalization and simplification. Ironically enough, this kind of scepticism,                                      questioning that 1 recommend is also the result of developments in theory. In                                      subsequent blocks you will be told about \"subject positions\", \"interpellation\" and so                                      on. Also, questions of historiography have contributed to this kind of scepticism. Let                                      me then proceed with my version of what happened in the earlier decades to English                                      Studies.                                       Until the first quarter of the 19\" century higher education in England was a monopoly                                      of the Church of England, and confined to Oxford and Cambridge. These two ancient                                      universities were like all-men-monasteries in the form of colleges. The teachers were                                      unmarried church men and like them students were all housed in the'colleges.                                      Ancient Greek and Latin literature , Divinity and Mathematics were the subjects of                                      study. In 1826 a university college was for the first time founded in London opening                                      up facilities to men and women of all religions. From 1828 English was offered as a                                      subject for study and the first English professor was appointed in 1829. However it  .                                      was English language rather than literature which received the main thrust.  The                                      inclusion of literature come about in 1840 when F. D. Morris was appointed professor                                      at King's College. He said what Arnold was to take up programmatically,later : The                                      study of English literature, he said, would serve 'Yo emancipate us..  . from the notions                                      and habits which are peculiar to our own age\". He also stressed on \"fixed and                                      endearing\" values that literature highlighted. This can be taken as the central tenet of                                      liberg1 humanism with an appeal to high moralism supposedly beneficent to human                                      kind. The apparent absence of political motive or ideology cannot stand a moment's                                      scrutiny; because, both what Morris (1834-1896) said and what Matthew Arnold                                      made a life long crusade were indicative of the threat that the rising working class","forces posed for the traditional ruling class. English was to be a substitute for   Literature,             religion, now that faith had given way to doubt, and religion had all but lost    Criticism             credibility. With its ideological baggage depleted, religion had to be replaced by a   and Theory             new ideological.baggage. Hence, Arnold's prophecy that poetry (criticism) would             replace religion. We will soon see how Eliot's and the new critics' conservatism and             Leavis's appeal to literary values will make last ditch attempts at saving liberal             humanism from growing attacks from rival camps mostly from the political left,             which had already dubbed religion as the opium of the people. If you want to know             more about this you must read such books as The Sociul Mission Of English Studies             1848-1  932 by Chris Baldick, Re-reading English edited by Peter Widdowson, and             The Rise of English Studies by D. J. Palmer, as well as The Moment of Scrutiny by             Francis Mulhem.                1.3  THEORY BEFORE THEORY              The theory that ruled the world of literary criticism, without purporting to be theory,             was or has been known as \"liberal humanism\". Here are some of the basic tenets of             the creed, which Peter Barry lists in his book Beginning Theory:               1.     That literary value is transcendental.  That is, good literature is of timeless                     significance; such writing is \"not for an age, but for all time\" (Ben Johnson                     had said of Shakespeare). More recently, in the 20~ century Ezra Pound has                     defined literature as \"news which stays news.\"              2.      That a literary text contains its own meanings within itself and it does not                     require any elaborate process of placing it within a context, whether this                     latter be                     a)     Socio-political                     b)     Autobiographical                     c)     Literary-historical              As critics, the liberal humanists adhere to the approach which  insists upon the             primacy and self sufficiency of the \"words on the page\", the black marks.             ,  3.     That to understand the text well it must be detached from these contexts and                     studied in isolation. (Though some pre-theory critics would disagree with                     such a generalization).              4.      That human nature is essentially unchanging.               5.     That individuality is something securely possessed within each of us as our                     unique \"essence\". The discipline as a whole believed in what is now called                     the transcendent subject, 'which is the belief in the individual (the \"subject\").               6.     That the purpose of literature is specially the enchantment of  life the                     propagation of humane values.               7.     That form and content in literature must be fused in an organic way, so thqt                     one grows inevitably from the other.              8.     That sincerity (comprising truthfulness towards experience, honesty towards                     the self, and the capacity for human empathy and compassion) is a quality                     which inheres in the language with which literature is made.               9.     That what is valued in literature is the \"silent\" showing and demonstrating of                     something, rather than the explaining, or saying, of it.","10.    That the job of criticism is  to interpret the text, and to mediate  between it                                              and the reader.                                        1.4  IMMEDIATE CONTEXTS                                             .                                        The main impulse towards literary theory as it now comes to us, rose in the wake of                                       the modernist movement. As Aijaz Ahmad says, even the \"more advanced sectors of                                       English studies during the period between the two World Wars were dominated by                                       four main..  . tendencies: the practical criticism of  I. A. Richards; the conservative,                                       monarchist, quasi-Catholic criticism of T.S. Eliot; some elements of avant-gardist                                       modernism which nevertheless remained much less theorized in the English-speaking                                       countries than in continental Europe; and the then newly emergent 'New Criticism' of                                       Ransom, Tate and others in the United States\" (p.46).                                         The resistance to such exclusivist and technicist (that is emphasising technique),                                        criticism developed in England first, where there was an older tradition of socially                                       conscious literary study. (You must not be perturbed by such jargon and neologisms                                       as \"exclusionist\" and \"technicist\" as they are coined from the simple words you use:                                       \"exclusive\" and \"technical\". F.R Leavis instituted and led the Scrutiny group by                                       assimilating some of the pedagogical strategies of practical criticism; just as this                                       latter, developed and sponsored by 1.A Richards, had made special attempts to make                                       a science of literary criticism, and a strong plea for eliminating subjective                                       appreciation of literaturelpoetry. Leavis's close reading also made an attempt to                                       define objective criteria for literary analysis to displace the aristocratic notions of                                       literary \"taste\", while trying to locate the new texts of English literature in the larger                                       story of English social life. Ironically enough, the whole Scrutiny enterprise has been                                       seen in more recent times as itself  being part of a conservative bourgeois                                       undertaking. As 1 recount later, this is an episode in the history of the rise and   1                                       mission of English. This history has been encouraged at least in part by the cultural                                       studies of Raymond Williams who was influenced by the Marxist intellectual                                       movement of his times.                                        Frank Lentricchia who has tried to trace the histoj. of \"theory\" in his book A8er the                                       New  Criticism says, how \"By about 1957 the moribund condition of the New                                       Criticism and the literary needs it left unfblfilled placed us in a critical void. Even in                                       the 1940s, however, those triumphant times of the New Criticism, a theoretical                                       opposition was quietly gathering strength\" (p.4). Whereas the New Critics                                       concentrated on the text as an autonomous entity, the new opposition tried to absorb                                       the isolated text into large mythic structures.  Northrop Frye in his Anatomy of                                       Criticism (195 7) made the decisive break with the New Critical past absorbing                                       scattered dissidence. While carrying out his critical-theoretical mission, Frye made a                                       series of anti-New-Critical remarks, and called the New Criticism \"the aestheticist                                       view\".  The New Critics, he said, behaved as ifthey were in possession of special                                       techniques, which enabled them to engage in vaguely sacramental activity. He                                       describedthe activity as made up of cryptic comment and ritual gesture which were                                       too occult for comprehension. Frye's purpose was, as Geoffrey Hartman was to say,                                       to democratize criticism, and demystify the muse. If you are uninitiated in                                       contemporary theorists, and have been reading them now trying to understand their                                       work, you might think \"how silly\" it was on their part to think that way. But, many                                       students in those decades were in awe of their teachers who taught the New Critical                                       way. They thought of their teachers as people who possessed special knowledge of                                       hidden meanings of texts to which they, the students, themselves had no clue.  You                                       may now be inclined to say the same thing about the theorists, especially if you are                                       among the uninitiated. But the actual democratization has taken place in the shape of                                       the large number of critical-theoretical practices you now can choose from.  Many","such backward glances during the mid-2oth century saw a correspondence between    Literature,               the New Critical practices and the growth and evolution of literary modernism.    Criticism                                                                                                 and Theory               A case in point is Eliot, and the highly influential role that he and other modernist               poet-critics played in changing the course of English literature and literary criticism.               Assessing his own literary criticism later in life, Eliot claimed that his criticism was               the by-product of his poetry workshop. His early essays, he said, tried to justify and               defend the kind of poetry he and his friends were writing at the time. Tmly enough,               his early essays, such as \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\", emphasized               \"impersonality\" in art. Simultaneously, when he talked about the fhction and tools of               literary criticism he valued  \"comparison and analysis\", and chided biographical and               historical criticism. However, Eliot often contradicted himself. The critics who came               to value modem poetry,  such as I. A. Richards, severed the text from its context, and               called such analysis of poetry without any reference to the poet's life or times,               \"Practical Criticism\". Poetry thus became the dominant subject for criticism.  So               much so, they returned to the classical tradition of calling all literature poetry.               Shakespeare's plays were also looked at as poems.                 1.5    FROM CRITICISM TO THEORY                 Aijaz Ahmad begins the Introduction to his well-known book, In Theory, by saying               that \"The notable development in literary studies, as these have evolved in all the               English-speaking countries over the past quarter-century or so, is the proliferation,               from a great many critical positions, of what has come to be known simply as               'theory\"'. This explosion of \"theory\" is due to radical disagreement over interpreting               almost every social, cultural phenomenon. Whereas social scientists evolved theories               earlier in order to tune their investigation to scientific methods, literary critics took               their cue from the social scientists. And, social scientists included literature in the               broad scope of their investigation. By criticism, then, what we need to understand in               the context of pre-theory, is what has come to be known as the liberal humanist               tradition. In fact \"liberal humanism\" stands as an antonym to \"theory\", though I               should think that the former is itself a theoretical position.                Let me explain briefly to you what I mean by this.                Though moL of the New Critics were conservative in their ideological stance, many               others were liberal humanists.                As early as the 1930s, Rene Wellek and F.R. Leavis debated such fimdamental issues                as the relationship between philosophy and \"literary\" criticism in the latter's journal,               Scrutiny. 'Wallek pointed out to Leavis his dissatisfaction with the position of literary                criticism being carried out without the teaching of larger philosophical arguments and               thus in a \"theoritical vacuum\". What he actually complained of Leavis's reading of               the romantics was that Leavis had not stated his \"assumption more explicitely\" and                \"defended them substantially\" [Scrutiny. March 1937.  P.3761.                  The works of all the figures discussed in this section can be found in the collection               English Critical Texts , ed. D. J. Enright and Ernest de Chickera (Odord University                Press, 1962).                 It is perhaps unnecessary to supply a \&ll-scale example of  humanist practice, since               that practice will surely be fitmiliar to whoever is reading the book.                  1.6  THE COMMUNICATION CHAIN                  Before I end this unit, 1 want to draw your attention to an important concept which               helps us to differentiate between various theories. This is the \"communication chain\"","An Introduction       Roman Jacobson (pronounced yakobson) has given us a very convenient structure of                                     the communication chain, by looking at art or literature as an act of communication                                     It is a tripartite structure which can be represented through the following sketch:                                      Addresser                                  Addressee                                     (Author)                     CODE          (Reader)                                     --Context--           (Tedmessage)         --Reader's context--                                      You will notice that critics and theoreticians have tended to concentrate on one of the                                     three parts of any given literary work.  Though no reading or theory can strictly and                                     exclusively confine its attention to one of the three nodes, it is the accent on one or                                     the other of the three that lends its character to a theory/reading. Some critics                                     concentrate on the analysis of the text itself and exclude all considerations of the                                     author's biography or historical situation.  Some others concentrate on the author's                                     life and times; and yet others on the reader's own perceptions. The third almost deny                                     the objectivity of the text, even the existence of the author.  Hence such titles as \"Is                                     there a text in the Class?\" or \"The Death of the Author\", or \"The Birth of the Reader\".                                      1.7    LET US SUM UP                                       I have h this unit tried to analyze the subtle and not so subtle distinctions between                                     literature and criticism, as well as bterary criticism and theory. We saw that :                                             Theory i.e. the impulse towards thinking about the act of literary \&ticism  or                                            judgment was always there.                                              That there was a time when some critics acted as if they did not use any                                            theory.                                              That liberal humanism which is often foisted as an alternative to theory is                                            itself a theory.                                      I have further tried to trace in this unit a bief history of how \"criticism\" has given                                     way to \"theory\" in the 20'  century, and particularly isolated those \"non-literary\"                                     considerations, ideologies, which went into the making of pre-theory criticism.                                           1.     What would your answers be if you are confronted by the question: why do                                            you like a particular piece of writing?                                      2.     What is the difference between critique and criticism? Think about this and                                            write your answer.                                     ,   .                                     3.     List some of the critical theories bd theorists you have come across.

But is theory                                     peculiar to the study of literature in the later half of this century? One reason why                                     students of literature find it difficult to grasp theory is their general ignorance of the                                     Western philosophical traditions. In this block it will not be possible to explain any of                                     them in detail. However, I will briefly touch upon some of the philosophical                                     foundations of Theory in this unit.                                      2.1    INTRODUCTION                                      I am sure you are aware of the commonplace statement that criticism is as old as                                     creation. William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks have said:  \"Because poets have a                                     strong tendency to form opinions about their craft and to use these opinions as part of                                     the message of their poems, we are likely to find literary theory of a sort as far back                                     as we can fmd poems\" @.I).                                      We are concerned here mostly with Western critical thought. Critical thought derives                                     from, general aesthetics which in turn is guided by philosophical debates and ideasc                                     about what Reality is, God, and the possibility of absolute knowledge. In fact, there                                     has always been a connection between philosophical thought and critical thought.                                     There has also been a correspondence between the pagan and Christian concept of the                                     Word and Logos. In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God.                                     There has been a correspondence between Word-world, and the world and word. Just                                     as philosophers have persistently tried to interpret the Word andlor the world to us,                                     aesthetic inquiry has focused on the literary word.                                       2.1.1   Critical Antiquity and Classical Heroes                                      Some very early Greek poets also show an awareness of, or through implication,                                     propound critical theory or practice. For example, when Homer or Milton begins his                                     epics with an invocation to the muse, he is uttering a theory about his poems-                                     namely, that they are written, with the help of divine inspiration. This idea has played                                     an influential role in subsequent critical theory.  Between Homer and Plato (c.42817-                                     c.348/7BC), considered to be the first conscious theoretician of literature, centuries"];
